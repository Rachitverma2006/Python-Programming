### **Problem 1: Simple Calculator**
**Scenario:**  
Create a menu-driven calculator program that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

**Menu Options:**  
1. Addition  
2. Subtraction  
3. Multiplication  
4. Division  
5. Exit  

**Expected Features:**  
- Create a class `Calculator` with methods for each operation.  
- Use instance methods to perform calculations.  
- Handle division errors gracefully (e.g., division by zero).

### **Problem 2: Temperature Converter**
**Scenario:**  
Design a program to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user can input a temperature in one scale and convert it to the other two.

**Menu Options:**  
1. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin  
2. Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin  
3. Convert Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit  
4. Exit  

**Expected Features:**  
- Create a class `TemperatureConverter` with methods for conversions.  
- Use formulas:  
  - Celsius to Fahrenheit: \( F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 \)  
  - Celsius to Kelvin: \( K = C + 273.15 \)  
  - Reverse conversions accordingly.

### **Problem 3: Number Properties Checker**
**Scenario:**  
Write a program to check various properties of a number. The user can input a number and check if it is even/odd, prime, or find its factorial.

**Menu Options:**  
1. Check if the number is even or odd  
2. Check if the number is prime  
3. Find the factorial of the number  
4. Exit  

**Expected Features:**  
- Create a class `NumberProperties` with methods for each property check.  
- Use a constructor to initialize the number.  
- Handle edge cases for prime and factorial calculations (e.g., negative numbers, zero).  

### **Problem 4: Simple Bank Account Manager**  
**Scenario:**  
Develop a menu-driven program to simulate a simple bank account management system. Users can check their balance, deposit money, and withdraw money.  

**Menu Options:**  
1. Check Balance  
2. Deposit Money  
3. Withdraw Money  
4. Exit  

**Expected Features:**  
- Create a class `BankAccount` with attributes `account_holder_name`, `balance`, and methods for each operation.  
- Use a constructor to initialize the account holderâ€™s name and starting balance.  
- Ensure proper validation (e.g., withdrawal amount should not exceed balance).  
- Display appropriate messages for invalid actions.

### **Problem 5: Basic Student Management System**  
**Scenario:**  
Create a program to manage basic student information, including adding a student, displaying details, and searching for a student by roll number.  

**Menu Options:**  
1. Add a Student  
2. Display All Students  
3. Search for a Student by Roll Number  
4. Exit  

**Expected Features:**  
- Create a class `Student` with attributes like `roll_number`, `name`, and `marks`.  
- Use a list to store multiple `Student` objects.  
- Provide methods to add a new student, display details of all students, and search for a student by roll number.  
- Include input validation and handle cases like duplicate roll numbers.
